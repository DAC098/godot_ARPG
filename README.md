# Godot ARPG

probably is not an RPG but whatever. this is my first completed game using the
Godot Engine. not the most well designed game but it is in a working state and
is playable. this followed a tutorial from
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9FzW-m48fn2SlrW0KoLT4n5egNdX-W9a
and used the assests provided from that tutorial. there is also an additional
asset used that is pixel art text from itch.io.
